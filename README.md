Problem statement: 

How does the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) influence carbon emissions and vehicle usage patterns across different regions?

Sub questions:


How does the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) influence carbon emissions and vehicle usage patterns across different regions?

How does the primary use and distribution of electric vehicles compare to non-electric vehicles across different regions?

What is the relationship between the increase in electric vehicle adoption and the reduction in carbon emissions from facilities within those regions?
